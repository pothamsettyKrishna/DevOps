# Virtual Machines

A virtual machine, or VM, is a digitized version of a physical computer. 

Virtual machines can run programs and operating systems, store data, connect to networks, and do other computing functions. However, a VM uses entirely virtual resources instead of physical components.

## Hypervisor

A hypervisor is a software layer, sometimes referred to as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), that enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine. 

It acts as a bridge, allocating the host machine's resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) to each VM, allowing them to operate independently.
